AnVRopomotron is a virtual museum of anthropology, especially the biological and archaeological fields. Seeing the Museum of Man (now Museum of Us) in San Diego as a child really fueled my fascination and drove my education and career path. I hope that this WebVR site conveys some of that feeling to others.

## Features
* Explore a museum in VR or in a browser.
* See how you compare to a gorilla, the tallest human ever, and a prehistoric Gigantopithecus.
* Look into the past with reconstructions of prehistoric primates.
* In VR, pick up artifacts to examine life size at all angles
* Or, see the model large and spinning!
* Learn about a resident of colonial Jamestown, Viriginia based on his skeleton.

## Contributing to anVRopomotron
Thank you for your interest in AnVRopomotron! Think of this as my garage project: I'd like it to reflect my level of skill. Therefore I welcome bug fixes, tips, and leads, but not huge changes to code like new complete new features or rewrites of existing features. Thank you for your understanding.
